# Real-Time Chat Web Application using MERN Stack and Socket.io

## Introduction

This is a real-time chat web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and Socket.io. This application allows real-time chat and previous will be avaliable there.

## Features
- Real-Time Messaging: Chat with other users in real-time using WebSocket technology.
- User Online Typing: Users can see the typing status of other participants.
- Message History: View the chat message history of the previous chat.

2. **Message History**: You can scroll through the message history to view previous messages.

3. **Typing Status**: See the typing status of other users.


## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: Database for user information and chat messages.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for the server.
- **React**: Front-end library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side code.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication library for WebSocket support.
- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling for the front end.

## Further enhancements 
- **Registration and Login** Registration and login features can be added.
- **Privacy**: Chat privacy can be enhanced.
- **Security**: Security features can be added.

In summary, this project has a lot of learning scope.

## Purpose 
The main purpose of the project is to learn all the concepts of the MERN stack while doing things. Since chat applications are widely used applications and I am familiar with their features working on a similar project was itself a motivation.
